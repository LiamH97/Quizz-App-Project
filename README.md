    - The progress bar will fill up as you complete each question. The idea for how to impliment this was taken from this youtube video:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basf1lH1H-E&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified with my own modifications.

## Usage
The quiz was designed with an intuitive design in mind.
The user simply clicks on the answer they deem to be correct and the app will display green for a correct answer and red for incorrect.
A correct answer will also give them 10 points.
Reguardless of correct or incorrect answer the progress bar will increase as you move on to the next question.
Once the user reaches the defined max questions (10 as it stands), the app will return the user to the finish page (finish.html).
Here they can see their score and are asked if they would like to play again or return to the home page.
